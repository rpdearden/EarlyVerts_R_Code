Early vertebrates goals and questions
================

#Disparity

##Aims
* Compare disparity by phylogenetic group
* Test to ascertain significant differences
* Test disparity through time
* Get overall plot

##Outstanding stuff to check/fix
* How best to calculate distances
* Pros and cons of different methods - read up
* How to sensibly timeslice
* How to sample tree to work with

#Character rate

##Aims
* Measure overall rate of character rate through time
* Identify clades that have undergone particularly fast/slow rates of change

##Outstanding stuff to check/fix
* How to dichotomise tree
* How to sample tree to work with
